		i3status mplayer wrapper installation

Normally you just have to copy mplayer-wrapper.py into ~/.i3/contrib directory.
To use it, ensure your ~/.i3status.conf contains this line:
	output_format = "i3bar"
in the 'general' section.
Then, in your ~/.i3/config, use:
	status_command i3status | ~/i3status/contrib/mplayer-wrapper.py
in the 'bar' section.
